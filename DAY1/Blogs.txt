Blog 1: Difference Between HTTP/1.1 vs HTTP/2
Introduction
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the web. Over the years, this protocol has evolved to improve performance, security, and efficiency. HTTP/1.1 was the dominant protocol for many years, but HTTP/2, introduced in 2015, brought significant improvements. In this blog, weâ€™ll discuss the key differences between HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

1. Multiplexing
HTTP/1.1: In HTTP/1.1, only one request can be sent at a time over a single TCP connection. This limitation often led to bottlenecks and slower performance because browsers had to open multiple connections to fetch resources concurrently.
HTTP/2: Supports multiplexing, which means multiple requests and responses can be sent over a single connection simultaneously. This eliminates the need for multiple connections, thus reducing latency and improving performance.
2. Header Compression
HTTP/1.1: Headers are sent as plain text, and each request includes full header information, leading to redundancy and increased data transfer.
HTTP/2: Introduces header compression using HPACK, which reduces the size of headers by compressing them. This minimizes the amount of data sent over the network, leading to faster page loads.
3. Binary Protocol
HTTP/1.1: Uses a text-based protocol where requests and responses are sent as plain text. While easy to debug, this format can be inefficient.
HTTP/2: Switches to a binary protocol, which is more compact and efficient. Binary framing allows better parsing and handling of requests and responses, leading to faster data transmission.
4. Server Push
HTTP/1.1: Does not support server push. Resources are only sent to the client when requested.
HTTP/2: Enables server push, allowing the server to send resources to the client proactively before they are requested. For example, if a browser requests an HTML page, the server can push CSS and JavaScript files associated with the page, speeding up the page load.
5. Connection Management
HTTP/1.1: Requires separate connections for each resource request, which can cause congestion and delay.
HTTP/2: Utilizes a single connection that remains open for multiple requests, reducing the overhead of opening and closing connections.
Conclusion
HTTP/2 brings many improvements over HTTP/1.1, especially in terms of speed and efficiency. The introduction of multiplexing, header compression, server push, and a binary protocol makes HTTP/2 a better choice for modern web applications. Adopting HTTP/2 can significantly enhance the performance of websites and improve the user experience.

Blog 2: Objects and Their Internal Representation in JavaScript
Introduction
In JavaScript, objects are a crucial part of the language. They allow developers to store, access, and manipulate data efficiently. Understanding the internal representation of objects helps to write better code and optimize performance. This blog will explore how objects work internally in JavaScript.

1. What Are Objects in JavaScript?
In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs. The keys are strings (or Symbols), and the values can be any data type, including other objects, arrays, functions, or primitives.
Objects can be created using object literals {}, the Object constructor, or classes.
2. Internal Representation
Internally, JavaScript engines (like V8, SpiderMonkey) store objects as a dynamic collection of properties. Objects are often represented as hash tables where each key maps to a memory address where the value is stored.
JavaScript uses hidden classes (similar to prototypes) to optimize how objects are accessed. When an object is created, the engine generates a hidden class. Each time a new property is added, the hidden class is updated.
3. Property Access
JavaScript uses a lookup mechanism to find properties on objects. If a property is not found on the object itself, the engine looks up the prototype chain until it finds the property or reaches the end of the chain.
This mechanism can make accessing properties slower if the prototype chain is long.
4. Prototype and Inheritance
JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance. Every object has an internal link to another object called its prototype. If a property is not found on the object, the JavaScript engine looks for it in the prototype.
This allows for inheritance, where objects can share properties and methods.
5. Optimizations in JavaScript Engines
JavaScript engines optimize objects using hidden classes and inline caching.
Hidden classes: When an object is created, the engine assigns a hidden class to it. If the object structure changes (e.g., adding new properties), a new hidden class is created.
Inline caching: Caches the locations of properties to speed up future access, making repeated access faster.
Conclusion
Understanding the internal workings of JavaScript objects helps developers write more efficient and performant code. Knowing how hidden classes and prototype chains work allows for optimizing property access and making better decisions when designing JavaScript applications.

Codekata Practice
Codekata is a term borrowed from martial arts, referring to the practice of coding exercises to sharpen programming skills. It involves solving small coding challenges regularly to improve problem-solving abilities.

Here are some steps to get started with Codekata practice:

Choose a Platform:

Websites like HackerRank, LeetCode, and Codewars offer a variety of coding challenges.
Start with Easy Problems:

Begin with simple problems to understand the basics. Gradually increase the difficulty level.
Practice Regularly:

Consistency is key. Practice a few problems every day to improve your skills over time.
Analyze Solutions:

After solving a problem, compare your solution with others. Learn different approaches to the same problem.
Brief Explanation: IP Address, Port, HTTP Methods, and MAC Address
IP Address:

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. It allows devices to locate and communicate with each other over the internet.
There are two versions: IPv4 (e.g., 192.168.1.1) and IPv6 (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).
Port:

A port is a logical endpoint that helps identify specific processes or services on a network. Each IP address can have multiple ports (e.g., HTTP uses port 80, HTTPS uses port 443).
Ports ensure that data is sent to the correct application on a device.
HTTP Methods:

HTTP methods are verbs used to specify the action to be performed on a resource.
GET: Retrieve data from the server.
POST: Send data to the server to create a new resource.
PUT: Update an existing resource on the server.
DELETE: Remove a resource from the server.
MAC Address:

A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications at the data link layer of a network.
Unlike IP addresses, MAC addresses are hardware-based and typically remain the same across networks.
